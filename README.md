# Split Bill Calculator

This is a Flutter Project that I have came up with which is to build a Split Bill Calculator
This is my first project that I try and commit to GitHub to share to people who might use this
calculator app on their own iPhone / Android. The database I used is HIVE (LOCAL STORAGE)


The core features include 

a) Split Bill Calculation depending on tax rate and amount of people
Formula = (Amount Per Person) * ((Amount Per Person * Tax Rate) / 100)

b) Calculate Bill that are split equally 
Formula = (Total Bill) / (Amount of People)

c) Record Owe Record
This function store records for people who owe you money
